Repository for "Dynamics of Periodic Mechanical Structures Containing Bistable Elastic Elements"

The results folder contains different folders for the simulations of the different regimes of wave propagation.

Folders in Results:
exact solution - Plot of the exact solution. Open the mathematica file exactSolution2.nb to view the plot of the exact solution. final figures - Contains pdfs of all the figures in our paper. 
large displacements - The folder contains the values of the displacements in Displacements.txt. Open and run the mathematica file results.nb to display the results of simulations for the large displacement regime.
mathematica programs - The mathematica file taylor.nb depicts the bistable potential. The dispersion relation is plotted in the mathematica file in the subfolder.
medium displacements - The folder contains the values of the displacements in Displacements.txt. Open and run the mathematica file results.nb to display the results of simulations for the medium displacement regime.
precompression - Here there are displacement results for different cases of precompression. Along with that it includes a mathematica file which summarizes the wave velocity for different values of precompressions. 
small displacements - The folder contains the values of the displacements in Displacements.txt. Open and run the mathematica file results.nb to display the results of simulations for the small displacement regime.

Files in Movies:
This folder includes movies for the different cases of wave propagation.
